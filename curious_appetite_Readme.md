# Curious_Appetite - WEB DESIGN - PROJECT

## Group Members: 
 1) Milind Kate - #1118543
 2) Ankita Panjwani -#1123289

## Work Distribution:

We had divided the project into two parts:

Among the 4 pages of the whole website; we have allocated 2 pages to each of the group members.

### Ankita: I was working on Home Page/Landing Page and Contact Us Page.
I started with building the header which is needed on all pages of the website that we are building. Then I have tried to make the landing pages attractive by adding image slider which represents food items and also a parallax which grabs the attention of the user.I have used mobile first approach for the designing part and I have used form in the contact us page as we are asking users for their feedback.

### Milind: I was working on Product Detail Page and SignIn/SignUp Page. 
For product detail page, I took reference from various food delivery sites and came with unique design and have implemented that using html, css. A menu has been shown along with details of the restaurant with some offers and visual displays of the food items have been added. I have made product detail page and signin/signup page responsive for multiple screen sizes.

### Proximity
We have used proximity for listing all restaurants and food items that will have space after each and every item which helps to improve accessibility compliance.
We used the tabindex on each page to navigate through each element of page.
We used proper colour contrast for the design pages for better visual appearance.

### Web Accessibility:

For our website's web accessibility we have added alt attribute in all the image tags that we have used. For the disabled people, we have also added tabindex for the screen readers to read out the content. And we have included aria-label attribute for giving accessible names to different sections of our website. Moreover, we have also placed other attributes like name, placeholder and value wherever necessary in the whole website to improve web accessibility.

### Search Engine Optimization:

We have included meta tags with keywords and description which are helpful for the search engine spiders to crawl through our website. We have added the best suited description for individual pages in our website.
Things we have used - 
1.We have used the long tail keywords inside the metatag. 
2.Create unique <title> elements for each page.
3.Added description in meta tag.
4.Used unique headings for each page.
5.Used a tag for navigation through pages.
