# Curious_Appetite - WEB DESIGN - PROJECT

## Group Members: 
 1) Milind Kate
 2) Ankita Panjwani

## Work Distribution:

We had divided the project into two parts:

Among the 4 pages of the whole website; we divided 2 pages to each of the group members.


### Ankita: I was working on Home Page/Landing Page and Contact Us Page.
I started with building the header which is needed on all pages of the website that we are building. Then I have tried to make the landing pages attractive by adding image slider which represents food items and also a parallax which grabs the attention of the user.I have used mobile first approach for the designing part and I have used form in the contact us page as we are asking users for their feedback.

### Milind: I was working on Product Detail Page and SignIn/SignUp Page. 


### Web Accessibility:

For our website's web accessibility we have added alt attribute in all the image tags that we have used. For the disabled people, we have also added tabindex for the screen readers to read out the content. And we have included aria-label attribute for giving accessible names to different sections of our website. Moreover, we have also placed other attributes like name, placeholder and value wherever necessary in the whole website to improve web accessibility.

### Search Engine Optimization:
